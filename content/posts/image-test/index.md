So, how do we get responsive images?

At first, I reached for shortcodes, and got about 90% of the way there. But then I realized that shortcodes cannot be invoked from the definition of a shortcode -- only from the body of a piece of content.

So at that point, I reached for partials instead. Partials are slightly less ergonomic because they seem to have some strangeness around argument passing. Arguments can only be passed through a dictionary manually.

This works.
