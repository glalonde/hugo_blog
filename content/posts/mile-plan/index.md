# Goal is 4:59.

Jack Daniels timings. I'll ignore `T`.`I` and `R` correspond with aerobic and anaerobic intervals.

# Aerobic intervals
According to JD, aerobic interval training(`I`) is for VO2Max, so this should be a pace that can be maintained for ~11 minutes max. Running faster than this pace will only serve to shorten the duration spent at VO2Max, and is thus counterproductive. The recovery for these intervals should be incomplete, so 1:1 with actual running time. This amounts to spending less time ramping to Vo2Max, and more time at VO2Max.

The mile is run about 10% faster than VO2Max.

## Examples of aerobic interval workouts for weekly mileage of 30.

- 4-5x(800m `I`, 2 min jog).
- 4x(3 mins `I`, 2 min jog).
- 3x(4 mins `I`, 3 min jog).
- 8x(2 mins `I`, 1 min jog).
- 4x(1000m `I`, 3 min jog).

# Anaerobic intervals
`R` training in contrast is for speed or something. Not totally sure, but the main differences are:
- Roughly 6s faster pace per 400m
- Complete recovery of at least 2x the running time
- Really don't give in the form department here.

## Examples of anaerobic interval workouts for weekly mileage of 30.

- 16x(200m `R`, 200m jog).
- 8x(400m `R`, 400m jog).
- 4x(600m `R`, 600m jog), 4x(200m `R`, 200m jog).

# Weekly plan for 30 miles

Each week should have a long run, and at least one of `I` workout and `R` workout, and ideally one of each. Between these should be `E` runs to pad mileage.

| Day | Activity | Approximate Mileage |
| --- |--- | --- |
| Sunday | Long run 60-70 mins `E` | 7.5 - 9 |
| Monday | `E` | 5 |
| Tuesday | 20 mins `E` + `R` workout + 10 mins `E` | 6 - 8 |
| Wednesday | `E` | 5 |
| Thursday | 20 mins `E` + `I` workout + 10 mins `E` | 6 - 8 |
| Friday | N/A | 0 |
| Saturday | Cross train, biking | 0 |
