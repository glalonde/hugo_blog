One consideration here is it needs to be simple. I'd rather not keep track of a large number of things, and I'd rather workouts be easily comparable between weeks to gauge progress.

| Day | Activity |
|---|---|
|Monday| 2 mile warmup, 6-8x400m @ 75s with 60s rest |
|Tuesday| Easy run, 5 miles @ 8-8:30 |
|Wednesday| Easy run, 5 miles @ 8-8:30 |
|Thursday| 2 mile warmup, 3-4x800m @ 2:30 with 2:00 rest |
|Friday| Rest |
|Saturday| Cross train, biking |
|Sunday| Long run, 8-10 miles @ 8-8:30 |
